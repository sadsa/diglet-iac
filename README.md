## 📖 Overview

The **Diglet IaC** project provides a robust framework for provisioning and managing the infrastructure required to run the **Catchem** application. By leveraging Terraform, we can define our infrastructure in a declarative manner, ensuring that our environment is reproducible, scalable, and easy to manage.

### 🌟 Features

- 🌱 Infrastructure as Code: Define your infrastructure using Terraform configuration files.
- 📜 Version Control: Keep track of changes to your infrastructure over time.
- 🛠️ Modular Design: Easily manage and reuse infrastructure components.
- ⚡ Automated Provisioning: Quickly spin up or tear down environments as needed.
