# Diglet IaC

Welcome to the **Diglet IaC** repository! Just like the Pokémon Diglett, which burrows underground to manage its environment, this repository is dedicated to managing the infrastructure for the **Catchem** app using Terraform and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.

## Overview

The **Diglet IaC** project provides a robust framework for provisioning and managing the infrastructure required to run the **Catchem** application. By leveraging Terraform, we can define our infrastructure in a declarative manner, ensuring that our environment is reproducible, scalable, and easy to manage.

## Features

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Define your infrastructure using Terraform configuration files.
- **Version Control**: Keep track of changes to your infrastructure over time.
- **Modular Design**: Easily manage and reuse infrastructure components.
- **Automated Provisioning**: Quickly spin up or tear down environments as needed.

## Getting Started

To get started with the **Diglet IaC** project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diglet-iac.git
   cd diglet-iac
   ```

2. **Install Terraform**: Make sure you have Terraform installed on your machine. You can download it from [terraform.io](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

3. **Configure Your Environment**: Set up your cloud provider credentials and any necessary environment variables.

4. **Initialize Terraform**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

5. **Plan Your Infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

6. **Apply Your Configuration**:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
